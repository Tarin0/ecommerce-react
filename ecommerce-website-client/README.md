I've developed an e-commerce website with a range of features to enhance the shopping experience for users. Here's an overview of the key features in the project:

**1. Brand Selection on Home Page:**
   - Users are welcomed to the home page where they can see a list of brand names represented by different products.
   - They can select a specific brand name to explore the products available from that brand.

**2. Brand-Specific Product Listings:**
   - After selecting a brand, users are directed to a private route that displays all the available products associated with that brand.
   - This allows users to focus on products from a specific brand of their choice.

**3. Product Details:**
   - Within the products section, users can click on individual product listings to view detailed information.
   - The product details page provides information such as product description, price, rating, and other relevant details.

**4. Product Update Functionality:**
   - Users have the ability to update product information by clicking on an "Update" button within the product details page.
   - They can modify details such as the product name, brand name, image, price, and rating.

**5. Add Product Feature:**
   - A private route is provided for users to add new products to the website.
   - This feature allows users to contribute to the catalog of available products.

**6. Shopping Cart:**
   - After logging in, users can access a "My Cart" section where they can view and manage their selected products.
   - The shopping cart displays the products a user has added and allows them to make changes as needed.


**7. User Account Management:**

Users can register for an account using Firebase authentication, providing a secure and convenient method for creating and managing their profiles.

**8. Social Media Authentication:**

Firebase allows users to log in using popular social media accounts like Google without registering.
